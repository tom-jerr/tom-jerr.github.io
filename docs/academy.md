## Bio

I am a first-year master student majoring in Computer Architecture in [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). Currently, I am a member at [NDSL](https://github.com/uestc-ndssl/). You could find my previous experience [here](#experience). In addition, I am interested in Database, Distributed System and Vector Database.

> [!INFO] I am actively contributing to the open-source community, particularly in projects related to distributed databases and Vector Database. If there are any opportunities to participate in the development of these kinds of open-source projects, please feel free to contact me !!! 🥰🥰🥰

## Work Interest

<!-- - **Large Language Model Interferce and Optimization**: I am learning one of the most famous structure in LLM interferce field, which is SGLang. I am confused about how to find a job about this area, what need I to study ? -->

- **Distributed Database**: I focus on Distributed Database. Last year, I and my partners have won the 11th in 2024 OceanBase Database Competition. Now I am working for a simple distributed vector database or olap with vectorized query engine, if you have any idea, welcome to contact with me.

- **Vector Database**: I also foceus on vector database and Graph RAG on this field. Now I am working for adding the ability of vector search on a graph database. I want to do some optimization on vector search with hnsw, if you have any idea about hnsw, welcome to contact with me.
